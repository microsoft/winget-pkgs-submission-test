# Welcome to the Windows Package Manager Submission Test repository
**WARNING: This is NOT the real Windows Package Manager Community repository.** This repository is a mirrored copy of the [official Windows Package Manager Community repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) and serves as a test repository for testing and validating manifest submissions to GitHub for the [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator (Winget-Create)](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) tool.

We encourage anyone who wishes to make improvements to [Winget-Create](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) to test and validate their changes using this repository. Since the tool aims to streamline the submission process, we do not want to overload the official WindowsPackage Manager Community repository with our test submissions. 

## How to test Winget-Create using this repository.
